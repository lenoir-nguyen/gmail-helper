# Gmail Helper — Build Log & Conversation Summary

**Date**: 2026-05-28  
**Status**: Local development complete, fixes applied, ready for production deployment  
**Repo**: https://github.com/lenoir-nguyen/gmail-helper

---

## What We Built

A personal Gmail data extraction tool that:
1. Connects to Gmail via OAuth (read-only)
2. Searches emails using a multi-agent AI pipeline
3. Extracts structured data from email confirmations
4. Populates a Word (.docx) or Excel (.xlsx) document with the results
5. Returns the populated document as a download

Primary use case: **Job application tracking** — finds all "Thank you for applying" confirmation emails and fills a Word tracker document.

## Architecture

```
Frontend (Next.js 16 + Tailwind) → Vercel
Backend (FastAPI Python)         → Railway
```

## Local Development Setup

```
Backend port: 8001 (port 8000 is taken by another project: lenoir-assistant)
Frontend port: 3000
```

### Backend
```powershell
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
# OR with UTF-8 fix for Windows:
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"; .\.venv\Scripts\uvicorn.exe main:app --reload --port 8001
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Backend .env (already filled, never commit)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=911713640000-...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-...
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8001/auth/google/callback
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
PYTHONUTF8=1
```

---

## Gmail OAuth Scopes (READ-ONLY FOREVER)

```python
GMAIL_SCOPES = [
    "openid",
    "userinfo.email",
    "userinfo.profile",
    "gmail.readonly",   # ← NEVER add write scopes
]
```

---

## The 18 Search Queries (search_agent.py)

For job application tracking, Agent 1 runs all of these:

```
"thank you for applying"
"thanks for applying"
"thank you for your application"
"thanks for your application"
"thank you for submitting your application"
"thank you for your recent application"
"we received your application"
"we've received your application"
"your application has been received"
"your application was received"
"application successfully submitted"
"successfully submitted your application"
"thank you for your interest" + (position OR role OR engineer OR developer...)
subject:application + (thank you OR received OR confirmation OR submitted)
subject:applying
subject:"your application"
subject:"application received"
subject:"application submitted"
subject:"application confirmation"
```

Each query is paginated — follows Gmail's `nextPageToken` until all results are fetched (no record cap).

---

## Document Population — How It Works

### Header matching (fuzzy, doc_service.py)
- Normalises text: lowercase, strip `_-/&,;:()'"`, collapse whitespace
- Scores matches: exact=3, contains=2, word overlap=1
- Agent field `date_of_application` → document header "Date of Application" → score 3 ✓

### Row writing (XML clone, NOT python-docx add_row)
```python
def _clone_row(table, row_data, col_map):
    template_tr = table.rows[-1]._tr
    new_tr = deepcopy(template_tr)           # copy last row's XML
    for t_el in new_tr.findall(f".//{_W}t"):
        t_el.text = ""                        # blank all text
    table._tbl.append(new_tr)               # attach to table
    # then write values directly into <w:t> elements
```

`table.add_row()` was abandoned because it creates cells with no style inheritance, resulting in blank rows in complex styled documents.

## Extracted Fields (Job Application Mode)

| Agent Field | Document Header |
|---|---|
| `date_of_application` | Date of Application |
| `method_of_application` | Method of Application |
| `company` | Company |
| `position` | Position |
| `expense` | Expense (always empty) |
| `interview_offer_of_employment` | Interview/Offer of Employment (always empty) |
| `accepted_rejected_reason` | Accepted/Rejected & Reason — `no response` / `rejected` / `interviewed` / `accepted` |

---

## Ideal Prompt for Job Application Tracking

```
Find all job application confirmation emails since April 1, 2026. For each
application found, extract:
- Date of Application: the date the confirmation email was received (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Method of Application: how I applied (LinkedIn, Indeed, Company Website, Referral)
- Company: the company name
- Position: the job title / role I applied for
- Expense: leave empty
- Interview/Offer of Employment: leave empty
- Accepted/Rejected & Reason: classify as "no response", "rejected", "interviewed", or "accepted"
  based on the email content

Sort results by date ascending (oldest first).
```

### Status Classification Rules (accepted_rejected_reason)

| Value | When to use |
|---|---|
| `no response` | Standard confirmation — received, under review, we'll be in touch (DEFAULT) |
| `rejected` | Not moving forward, regret to inform, position filled, other candidates |
| `interviewed` | Interview invitation, phone screen, schedule a call, next steps |
| `accepted` | Job offer, offer letter, congratulations, welcome to the team |

## Issues Encountered & Fixed

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Port conflict | lenoir-assistant uses port 8000 | Backend runs on port 8001 |
| TPM rate limit 429 | gpt-4o too many tokens | Switched to gpt-4o-mini |
| 404 on Gmail API calls | Deleted/archived emails | try/except returning error dicts |
| Context length exceeded | Too many emails in one conversation | Multi-agent split: search Python, extract LLM |
| ChatCompletionMessage not serializable | Pydantic model in messages list | `.model_dump(exclude_none=True)` |
| Download always .xlsx | CORS missing `expose_headers` | Added `expose_headers=["Content-Disposition","X-Summary","X-Row-Count"]` |
| Only 15 records returned | Hard cap of 30 on search | Raised to 500 per query |
| Only 12-50 records | No Gmail pagination | Implemented `nextPageToken` loop |
| Blank rows in Word doc | `cell.text=` destroys style XML | XML deep-copy + direct `<w:t>` manipulation |
| charmap encoding error | Windows console can't encode `→` `…` | `PYTHONUTF8=1` + replaced Unicode in print() |
| Agent stops at 2-12 records | LLM loses track across many tool calls | Architectural fix: Python does searching, LLM only extracts |
| Extract agent skips records | INCLUDE/SKIP logic too strict | Changed to "extract from ALL emails, never skip" |
| accepted_rejected_reason always empty | `_SYSTEM_PROMPT` hardcoded `always ""` | LLM now infers status from email body with explicit signal words |
| accepted_rejected_reason showing "waiting" | Old value in prompt before user renamed it | Updated to `"no response"` as default; restart backend to reload |
| Position showing "Not specified" | LLM only looked at subject line | Updated prompt to search body for "applied for", "position of", "the X role" |
| bold=True crash in doc_service fallback | `_set_cell_text()` doesn't accept bold param | Removed the invalid argument from fallback code path |

---

## CORS Configuration (main.py)

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[settings.frontend_url, "http://localhost:3000"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
    expose_headers=["Content-Disposition", "X-Summary", "X-Row-Count"],
)
```

`expose_headers` is critical — without it, the browser can't read `Content-Disposition` and the download always falls back to `result_timestamp.xlsx`.

## Production Deployment (TODO — next session)

### Backend → Railway
1. New project → Deploy from GitHub → `gmail-helper`
2. Root directory: `backend`
3. Environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/auth/google/callback
   FRONTEND_URL=https://YOUR-APP.vercel.app
   PYTHONUTF8=1
   ```

### Frontend → Vercel
1. New project → Import `gmail-helper`
2. Root directory: `frontend`
3. Environment variable:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://YOUR-APP.railway.app
   ```

### Google Cloud Console
After deploying, add to Authorized Redirect URIs:
- `https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/auth/google/callback`

---

## Current Results

- Local dev: fully working
- Job application tracking: ~150 records found (user's actual inbox count)
- Word document: populated correctly with all fields in right columns
- Download: returns correct .docx or .xlsx matching uploaded file type
- `accepted_rejected_reason` now populated: `no response` / `rejected` / `interviewed` / `accepted`
- `position` now searches email body when not found in subject line
- GitHub: https://github.com/lenoir-nguyen/gmail-helper (private repo)

## Session 2026-05-28 — Fixes Applied

### Changes made this session

1. **`accepted_rejected_reason` was always empty**
   - Root cause: `_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `extract_agent.py` said `always ""`
   - Fix: LLM now classifies based on email body with explicit signal words per status

2. **Status value renamed `"waiting"` → `"no response"`** (user's preference)
   - Updated in `extract_agent.py` prompt and all docs

3. **Status classification — 4 values with signal words**
   - `"no response"` — standard confirmation (default)
   - `"rejected"` — not moving forward, regret to inform, position filled
   - `"interviewed"` — schedule an interview, phone screen, next steps
   - `"accepted"` — offer of employment, congratulations, welcome to the team

4. **Position extraction improved**
   - Now searches email body for phrases like "applied for", "position of",
     "your application for", "the [Title] role", "opening for", "job title:"
   - Only falls back to "Not specified" if truly not found anywhere

5. **`bold=True` bug fixed in `doc_service.py`**
   - `_set_cell_text()` was called with `bold=True` in the fallback new-table path
   - Would crash if no matching table found in the document
   - Removed the invalid argument

### Pending
- Production deployment (Railway + Vercel) — deferred to next session
